# Quaternion

## Description
A quaternion can be used to store information about rotation of an object in 3 dimensions. 
I have no clue how it works. I am building this prototype to figure out the mathematics and make a simple rust library out of it.
This is just a personal project and shouldn't be used in production environments

## Run
- make sure you have cargo installed
- clone repo
- execure `cargo run` to start the CLI where you can interact with vectors and rotations
