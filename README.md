# Rapid Prototype Series: Quaternion

Time limit: 2 days

## Description
A quaternion can be used to store information about rotation of an object in 3 dimensions. 
I have no clue how it works. I am building this prototype to figure out the mathematics and make a simple rust library out of it.
This is just a personal project and shouldn't be used in production environments
